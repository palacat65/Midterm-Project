Project Overview
The College Management System is designed to streamline and automate various administrative and academic operations within a college. This system helps manage students, faculty, departments, and courses efficiently.

How to Clone and Run the Application
To set up the application, first, clone the repository and navigate into the project folder. Install the necessary dependencies for both PHP and JavaScript. Configure the environment by renaming the environment file and generating an application key. Set up the database by running migrations and seeding initial data. Finally, start the development server to run the application locally. Once started, the application should be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Git Workflow
Before making any changes, create a new branch. After implementing changes, stage and commit them with a meaningful message. Push the branch to the remote repository and create a pull request on GitHub for review. Once approved, merge the changes into the main branch. Always pull the latest changes before starting new work. After merging, delete the feature branch locally and remotely to maintain a clean repository.

Best Practices
Ensure that all changes are properly reviewed before merging. Keep commits small and descriptive. Regularly sync with the main branch to avoid conflicts. Follow a structured branching strategy to maintain project organization and version control integrity.
